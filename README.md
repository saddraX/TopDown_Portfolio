Hi!

This is a project where I showcased my programming skills. This project focuses on writing clean, expandable and reusable code. 

It's prototype of a top-down arena slasher game. I've implemented:
- Player input using Input System with two control schemes (Mouse&Keyboard and Gamepad),
- Equipment system,
- Items that are Scriptable Objects,
- Simple UI that shows current equipped items and gameplay statistics,
- Enemies with simple behaviour based on current wearing weapon,
- Enemies and items spawning (the items can be picked up by the player).

This project was created in Unity 2021.3.9f1.
